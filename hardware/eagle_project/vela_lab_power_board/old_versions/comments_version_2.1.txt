To correct:
- increase the width of trace N$2 (from usb to L1)
- move L1 and C14 closer to the usb port
- move C9 below Q1 (also C8 can be moved down a bit, anyway C8 is not critical)
- increase the width of the trace between D5 and MAX17710
- move diode BOOST (and LX if possible) down close to the MAX17710
- move D2 and R9 below D5
- allign USB and CHG (and if possible all the others) testpoints to 0.1" grid
- change the name to USB testpoint to VDD_CHG
- V_SOLAR trace can be reduced if needed
- increase the width of trace between MAX17710 to LX
- add vias to GND planes

Doubts (check on datasheets):
- are both R7 and R8 needed?
- is D2 placement suggested in the datasheet? I would rather connect it at the LX input
- is that correct that SEL1 is floating?
- are you sure you have to connect C23 even if we do not use the internal regulator?

To be defined:
- R9 value (I thing it can be a short, but maybe on the datasheet they suggest something else)
- values of RTPS1, RTPS2 and RTPS3 to have VDD=3.3V. If you need it the minimum accptable value is around 2V
