Test in vela with children coming out from school
The gateway's clock was not set, the children went out at 16:00
Some external nodes were probably in range (two of them were in the boxes, than the RSSI is high)
5 nodes where there
NODE ID:	LOCATION:
2			park
4			school exit
128			usafe route
132			between the church and the football field (safe route)
135			walking bus start

No control over the children and no groud truth is available
One of the nodes went offline at 16:00 more or less, and another one went offline a bit later (probably due to range problem)
