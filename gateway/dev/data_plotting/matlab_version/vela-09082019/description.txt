Test VELA with Elia and Davide.

Nodes have been placed in the morning, while pedibus emulation taken place in the afternoon (from 14:00).
The most interesting logs are 20190809-141430-*.log since they contain the experiments, at the end an OTA update on node 5 and 3 have been tried. The procedure went to the end on the node 5, however the node seems to not have been updated (not sure what happened).

The experiment consisted in Elia walking in a loop, a part of the loop was the safe path, while the other part was the unsafe one. This is repeated several times with different amount of nodes.
In particular, three loops with only one beacon (ID:0000FF0000F2), three with 17 beacons (0000FF0000F2, 00000000005E-00000000006C) and one with 33 beacons (0000FF0000F2, 00000000005E-00000000006C, 000000000040-00000000004E)
The start and finish timestamp of each trajectory are in description.pdf together with the map.
