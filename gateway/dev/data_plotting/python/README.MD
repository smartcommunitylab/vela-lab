NOTE: the log file format might have changed and these script are probably no more working and should be adapted. Please use the matlab/octave version 

This folder contains 3 scripts which are usefull for debugging or analyzing the log files of the gateway.

The first file, applog_plotting.py plots all the battery data and dropped packets based on the log file app.log. 
This file is generated by the script main.py which will run on the gateway during deployment. 
At the moment this script can only plot graphs based on the data of one node. 
Lines 14 and 22 decide from what node's data the graphs should be plotted.

contact_plotter.py plots the RSSI of Bluetooth beacons detections measured by the nodes. 
The data is gathered from the file contact.log which is also generated by the main.py script.
By default this script only works when there is data of 4 different nodes in contact.log, but this can easily be adjusted by:
-Changing the subplotvalues in lines 105 and 108
-Commenting or adding lines to lines 50-53

node_data_logging.py is a script that reads the serial data from a device and logs it to a file with a timestamp.
The file is called [timestamp]-data.log and a new one is generated every time the script is ran.
