Backend
========================

The Backend for this system is Thingsboard, the Smart Community group of FBK hosts and maintains an installation of Thingsboard available at https://iot.smartcommunitylab.it/.

Thingsboard is used to store the collected data and provide a convenient visualization of simple numeric values (i.e. battery levels), for that feature no code is required here since everything is done on the browser.
In this folder there is some code to query the database behind Thingsboard. In particular it pulls contact data which is really difficult to visualize with the dashboards provided by Thingsboard.
